# BrainFuck

Hi, I'm Jo King and this is my respository of brainfuck scripts I've written. 
I don't use any other programming languages to compile to brainfuck, writing in "pure" brainfuck as it is.
I usually assume non-wrapping, non-negative cells and assume that EOF either leaves the cell unchanged or returns 0. (Some of my earlier scripts assume wrapping)

If you want to learn a bit of brainfuck, feel free to look at the tips folder (though it's a little incomplete)
